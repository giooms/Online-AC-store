# Online AC store - Project
## Description 
Project for my first programming course at HEC Li√®ge (feb. 2021 - apr. 2021). The purpose was to create the website for a fictionnal brand selling AC units. 

The languages seen during class were HTML, CSS, php and mySQL. 

The website isn't responsive because of time constraints.
